# The Simpsons Data Dashboard
Home of the UO data analytics boot camp Project 2 for group TIKT

## Project Overview

### Topic: The Simpsons
Our group was inspired by a number of well made dashboards that summarize data about successful television shows ([The Office](https://pudding.cool/2017/08/the-office/), a prior [Simpsons project](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-simpsons-meets-data-visualization-ef8ef0819d13), and [another Simpsons project](https://toddwschneider.com/posts/the-simpsons-by-the-data/)). We began searching for data sets that would allow us to produce a similar dashboard and came across [“The Simpsons by The Data”](https://data.world/data-society/the-simpsons-by-the-data) from data.world. This data set was well formatted and included a large amount of easily quantifiable data.

### Step 1: Data Cleaning and Storage
The .csv files used had already been cleaned and formatted to a remarkable degree. All the cleaning that was needed for our purposes was to remove a number of blank columns that somehow were included in the script data. These .csv files were then each read by Python and uploaded to a MongoDB database for use in an API and for the visualizations to be included in the finished dashboard.
